          <p>
            After injuring myself conducting training in the Scottish Highlands I missed out 
            on my unit's deployment to Norway in early 2020. I used my spare capacity to begin the JHub 
            Coding Scheme modules. From then on my, desire to learn and continually upskill myself has been
            rekindled and I have recently applied to complete a BSc in Computing and IT (Software) at the Open University.

          <h3 class="ui header">Percy Hobart Fellowship</h3>
          <p>
            The Percy Hobart Fellowship is a bespoke, 12-week course to give immersive,
            hands-on experience in innovation to personnel in the Royal Navy. During Summer 2020
            I was fortunate enough to be selected to be part of the inaugural course where I worked
            with <a href="https://www.thefuturefox.com/">TheFutureFox</a>, a London based start-up. 
            Here I took on a variety of different tasks, from web development to competitor analysis.
